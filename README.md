The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how different HTML elements work together on a single web page. The file includes various examples of headings, paragraphs, images, tables, forms, and other essential HTML elements to provide a hands-on learning experience.

## File Structure

### Headings

- Showcases all six levels of HTML headings: `<h1>` through `<h6>`.

### Paragraphs

- Examples of paragraphs styled with various HTML text formatting elements, such as `<b>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, and `<strong>`.

### Links and Images

- A clickable hyperlink using the `<a>` tag.
- An embedded image using the `<img>` tag with `alt` text and dimensions.

### Tables

- Includes two tables: a basic table with borders and a table demonstrating `colspan` usage.

### Lists

- Demonstrates ordered lists `<ol>`, unordered lists `<ul>`, and description lists `<dl>`.

### Forms and Inputs

- Contains examples of text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons.
- A form with a `fieldset` and `legend` is used to collect user information.

### Semantic HTML Elements

- Includes semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<main>` to structure the content.

### Styling
